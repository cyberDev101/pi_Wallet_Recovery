# pi Wallet Recovery

 
Requirements:
1. pi wallet address (for this, you can get it in your pi app or maybe you do transactions with someone you know so that he can trace and give you your wallet address from the Blockchain explorer or if you have ever used the wallet to send it to exchange, check your exchange transactions to get the pi wallet address)
   
2. Mixed/combined pi wallet phrase key/Seed phrase (must be 24 word, or u can contact me to sort it out)
